new feature suggestion:
read cpu fan speed/voltage from computer mainboard

mistake 1:
programming pin RA0/ICDSPDAT pin19 on MCU is connected
with output pin3 of IC1 74HC4051. When
programmer is connected there will be two outputs
conflicting on the same line. This was fine with cd4051, but
not 74hc4051. Reason perhaps cd4051 has 125Ohm output and
74HC4051 has 70OHm output at 5V and drag the ICDSPDAT too
much.
- Suggest splitting sense line with 100ohm resistor, or
  better: move sense line and use RA0 as output
  (for example ctrb)
action: detatch swap SENSE with CTRLB.

mistake 2:
USB D+ and D- are crossed.

improvement 1:
LED1 and 2 to VDD not VCC

improvement 2:
jumper a bit close to heatsink. Remove jumper ?

Soldering the micro usb connector. There are four soldering
mounting terminals. One on each side and two underneath.
Seemingly there are no tabs underneath the connector, but
if solder is applied beforehand, then the casing can be
heated with tin underneath.
